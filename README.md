# green_bot
Python based Discord bot

A discord bot for use on a server mainly with friends and includes some inside jokes. Something that has been sort of randomly added to over time and is quite messy and I would like to actually clean up. It started as a bot to send encouraging messages if people were expressing negativty in chat and grew from there.

This bot is hosted on repl.it and utilizes keep_alive.py to stay up.

Generally the bot looks for certain keywords in messages and responds accordingly. Due to my sense of humor dad jokes are included. At one point the bot became a menace responding to any message starting with "I'm.." with "Hi <whatever came after "I'm>, I'm a bot. This had to be reduced to a slight chance of saying that after someone started a chat with "I'm", notably after the passing of my grandmother where a friend stated "I'm sorry for your loss" and the bot immediately chimed in with "Hi sorry for your loss, I'm a bot!".

Because of issues like that and other random things that have been added over time the bot has become a mess and it is an ongoing endeavor to now clean up the bot into a nicer less jumbled affair.
